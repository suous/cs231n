    "\n",
    "It is possible that once in a while a dimension in the gradcheck will not match exactly. What could such a discrepancy be caused by? Is it a reason for concern? What is a simple example in one dimension where a gradient check could fail? How would change the margin affect of the frequency of this happening? *Hint: the SVM loss function is not strictly speaking differentiable*\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\color{blue}{\\textit Your Answer:}$ *fill this in.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Yes, it is possible. \n",
    "2. The reason is that the function is not differentiable at the margin point, and the gradient check is calculated by the difference of the function value at the margin point, which may change greatly near the margin point.  For example, the $ReLU$ activation function $f(x)=max(0,x)$ is not differentiable at $x=0$. And the gradient at $x=0$ can be either 0 or 1, depending on the implementation.\n",
    "3. Usually, there is no need to worry too much, because the gradient check is only used to verify the correctness of the gradient calculation rather than optimize the model. But if there exists a large number of discontinuously derivable functions, it is necessary to pay attention to the gradient check, because the gradient check may fail frequently, and it hard to find the bug.\n",
    "4. For the $ReLU$ activation function $f(x)=max(0,x)$, according to the formula of numeric gradient, the gradient at $x=0$ is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f^{\\prime}(x) = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f^{\\prime}(0) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "        0 &h<0\\\\\n",
    "        1 &h>0\\\\\n",
    "        \\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Changing the margin can reduce the frequency of the gradient check failure. For the svm loss function, make the margin larger can enhance the area of the differentiable region, but it cannot solve the problem. Because the gradient check failure is caused by the discontinuity of the function, and the function is still discontinuous at the margin point. "

    "1. Different learning rates, regularization strengths, and number of iterations can lead to very different weights. In some cases, weights are similar to noise, and sometimes weights are like a combination of images of a certain category. And as the number of iterations increases and the loss decreases, the weights will become closer and closer to the template of a certain category, at least have the same color for the same category.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gradient descent is an iterative optimization process. Weights are updated in each cycle, and the model forces weights to be continuously updated to reduce the overall loss. And every image at the same category have similar features, so the weights of the same category will be updated in the same direction. And the weights of different categories will be updated in different directions. Therefore, for a certain category of images, the weight will be close to the template of the category.\n"
